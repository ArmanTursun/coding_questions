# Coding Questions
Coding interview questions ([LeetCode](#leetcode) &amp; [AlgoExpert](#algoexpert))

- All codes are written in Python.
- Feel free to add solutions with other languages.
- Since codes are copied from various editors, they may not be run directly. Treat them as `Pseudocodes`.

## How to practice coding (based on my experience)
- The questions in AlgoExpert are kindly selected questions that cover almost all basic data structures and algorithms, so they are really worth being practiced before interview.
- The questions in LeetCode are provided by official team and all users based on their interview experiences, it contains over 2000 questions.
- I think the best way to practice is first finish all problems in AlgoExpert and then go on with LeetCode.
- Watch video explanation on AlgoExpert and try by yourself. Then see the solutions of other users and also the discussion of the same question on LeetCode.
- Organize all solutions based on their time and space complexity, then compare solutions using different data structures and algorithms. Since there would be follow-up questions in actual interview that most likely would be the improvements of time and space complexity with better data structure and algorithm.
- I would say spending one hour for two easy problems and for one medium problem, or one to two hours for a hard problem would be proper. Just dig deeper into one problem.
- Don't waste your time on figuring out what kind of data structure or algorithm should be used. If you don't have any idea within 25 minute, just skip to the solution. 

## [AlgoExpert](/AlgoExpert)
Questions in AlgoExpert are categorized by data structure and then by difficulty.

These questions are from AlgoExpert, and the answers are my own code from my usual practice.
